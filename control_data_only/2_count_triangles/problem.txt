Given a positive integer N≥1, count how many distinct triangles can be formed using positive integers a,b,c such that:

1≤c≤b≤a≤N

The values a,b,ca,b,c can form a valid triangle, i.e., they satisfy the triangle inequality:

    a+b>c
    b+c>a
    c+a>b

Return the number of such distinct triangles.
